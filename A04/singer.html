    <h1>Break my heart</h1>
    <h2>Dua Lipa</h2>
    <p>[Verse 1] <br>
        I've always been the one to say the first goodbye <br>
        Had to love and lose a hundred million times <br>
        Had to get it wrong to know just what I like <br>
        Now I'm falling <br>
        You say my name like I have never heard before <br>
        I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure <br>
        I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all <br>
        Are you falling?
        <br></p>
        <em>
        [Pre-Chorus] <br>
        Centre of attention <br>
        You know you can get whatever you want from me <br>
        Whenever you want it, baby <br>
        It's you in my reflection <br>
        I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me <br>
        If I would've known it, baby <br>
        </em>
        <p>
        [Chorus] <br>
        I would've stayed at home <br>
        'Cause I was doing better alone <br>
        But when you said, "Hello" <br>
        I knew that was the end of it all <br>
        I should've stayed at home <br>
        'Cause now there ain't no letting you go <br>
        Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart? <br>
        Oh no, I was doing better alone <br>
        But when you said, "Hello" <br>
        I knew that was the end of it all <br>
        I should've stayed at home <br>
        'Cause now there ain't no letting you go <br>
        Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?</p>
